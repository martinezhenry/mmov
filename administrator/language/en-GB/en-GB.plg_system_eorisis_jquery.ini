;	jQuery Library
;	--------------
EO_JQ_LIB_STATE_DESC="<b>Auto Load:</b> The jQuery library will be loaded only when needed by the Joomla framework. In this case the plug-in checks if it exists in the 'head' section in ram, before the 'head' is even constructed. This will work for Joomla 3 core and can cover Joomla 3 extensions that use the Joomla framework functionality. Extensions that load jQuery in a different way will not be detected. Also active plug-ins that are forgotten and load the jQuery library and are set below 'eorisis jQuery' in the Plug-in Manager may also not be detected.<br><br><b>Always Load:</b> The jQuery library will be loaded in all cases.<br><br><b>Note:</b> If you run Joomla 2.5, the 'Auto Load' option will result in not loading the library, once in Joomla 2.5, jQuery does not exist in the Joomla framework."
EO_VERSION_CHOICE_LBL="Version to use:"
EO_VERSION_CHOICE_DESC="<b>Default:</b> Specific (Recommended)<br><br>Always check your website when upgrading to a new version of the jQuery library. It is recommended to always reference a Specific version of the jQuery library on a live website, unless you are during development or experimenting. Most important reason to avoid using the automatic Always Latest option is that an unexpected code change to a new version of jQuery library may cause compatibility issues to your current working scripts and cause them to stop working. Also, non specific version URLs pointing to a library on a CDN, usually (if not always) do not have a far-future Expires Header and as a result they will not be cached by the web browser, causing poor performance."
EO_SPECIFIC="Specific"
EO_LATEST="Always Latest"
EO_SOURCE_LATEST_LBL="CDN for 'Always Latest':"
EO_SOURCE_LATEST_DESC="You can get the latest version of the jQuery library automatically from the CDN of your choice. You need to select 'Always Latest' from the 'Version to use' option."
EO_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_LBL="Source for Specific:"
EO_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_DESC="If you have selected 'Specific' from the 'Version to use' options, here you can choose it's Source. To configure a Custom CDN, check the Advanced tab.<br><br>CDN (Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network) is a large distributed system of servers deployed in multiple data centers across the Internet. Using CDN as a Source you increase website performance dramatically.<br><br>A copy of every 'Specific Version' of the jQuery library exists in the /media/ directory of your website. Selecting 'Local / Custom CDN' will load the library from the local path (or your own CDN)."
EO_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_CDN_LBL="CDN for Specific/Custom:"
EO_SOURCE_SPECIFIC_CDN_DESC="If you chose to use a 'Specific' or a 'Custom' version from the 'Version to use' options, here you can choose it's CDN. Choose the one you think is best for you. All CDN Sources listed do have SSL available. The plug-in uses Scheme Relative (protocol-less or protocol-relative) URLs for all CDN sources (no http/https conflicts).<br><br><b>Note:</b> Google's domain is banned in some countries."
EO_VERSION_SPECIFIC_LBL="Specific Version:"
EO_VERSION_SPECIFIC_DESC="Recommended Series: 1.x.<br>Current Default Version: 1.11.2<br><br>jQuery 2.x has the same API as jQuery 1.x, but does not support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8.<br><br>To troubleshoot cases where old scripts are used on your website and you see unexpected results, lowering the jQuery version is a good practice although it is recommended to update your scripts and use an up-to-date jQuery version. If you use a CDN Source, always make sure that the Source does have the version you chose to use (especially if the version you chose is too new or too old)."
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_LBL="Custom Version:"
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_DESC="This field will only be used if you are using a CDN Source and the 'Version to Use' is set to 'Custom'.<br><br>If the version for the jQuery library you want to use does not exist in the 'Specific Version' list, then you may set it in this field and choose a CDN Source to load it from.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Having 'CDN Fallback' enabled, in case the version you set here does not exist on that source, then the 'Specific Version' will be used as a fallback. The field accepts only version characters. Example: 1.4.4rc2"
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_TYPE_LBL="Custom Version Type:"
EO_VERSION_CUSTOM_TYPE_DESC="Although the plugin is focused in using the minified type for live website performance, here you can also choose uncompressed. This is mainly for development purposes and is not recommended on a live website."
EO_MINIFIED="Minified"
EO_UNCOMPRESSED="Uncompressed"


;	-------
;	Migrate
;	-------
EO_MIGRATE_DESC="Migrate is only required for jQuery 1.9.0 or higher to restore deprecated and removed functionality. If you choose 'Auto Load' Migrate will load when using jQuery library 1.9.0 or higher."

;	---------
;	jQuery UI
;	---------
EO_UI_ELEM_DESC="Joomla core does not have any jQuery UI CSS files included.<br>jQuery UI, except the JavaScript (JS) files, comes with StyleSheets (CSS Themes). You can change theme using the 'Theme (CSS)' options."
EO_UI_THEME_DESC="Choose 'CDN' for a list of CDN sources or 'Local / Custom CDN' to load the file(s) from the local path (or your own CDN). To configure a Custom CDN, check the Advanced tab.<br><br>'Base' theme is used in UI 1.10.0 or lower versions and was brought back since version 1.11.3. If 'Base' theme is selected and the UI version selected is not within those version ranges, then 'UI Lightness' will be used.<br><br>Theme Images will be loaded only when using CDN as source or when using 'Use Custom UI Files'."
EO_UI_VERSION_DESC="<b>Current Default Version:</b> 1.9.2<br><br>jQuery UI 1.11.x and 1.10.x series need jQuery library 1.6+<br>jQuery UI 1.11.x series is Stable, while versions 1.10.4 or older are Legacy.<br>Versions below 1.10.1 have a 'Base' theme.<br>Versions below 1.10.0 have no minified CSS theme files except the 'Base' theme."
EO_UI_CUSTOM_LBL="Use Custom UI Files:"
EO_UI_CUSTOM_DESC="You can use the fields below to specify custom URL paths in the case you need to use versions that are not included in the plugin or you use Custom jQuery UI files.<br><br><b>Recommended Filenames for Local/Internal URLs:</b><br>jquery-ui.min.js<br>jquery-ui.min.css<br><br><b>Note:</b> When enabled, the State, Theme (CSS), Version, Source, CDN and CDN Fallback settings will be ignored, but the Area, Elements and CSS Media Type (Advanced tab) settings will still function. Take the time to check your HTML Source Code on your web browser well.<br><br><b>Custom jQuery UI Builder:</b> jqueryui.com/download<br><b>More Info:</b> eorisis.com/jquery"

;	-----------------
;	Twitter Bootstrap
;	-----------------
EO_BOOTSTRAP_DESC="Warning: In Joomla 3, it is fine to use any of the official Twitter Bootstrap 2.x series versions in the 'Site' (Front End) area. But using any official version in the 'Administrator' area when the default template is used, will break JavaScript functionality on some elements. Twitter Bootstrap 3.x series is currently not compatible with Joomla 3, but advanced users can use Custom Media and Remove Media fields. More info: eorisis.com/jquery/doc"
EO_BOOTSTRAP_THEME_DESC="Available in Twitter Bootstrap 3.x series only.<br>When enabled the file bootstrap-theme.min.css will be loaded as well, if the 'Elements' setting includes CSS."

EO_REMOVE_JS_LBL="Remove JS:"
EO_REMOVE_JS_URLS_LBL="Remove JS URLs:"
EO_REMOVE_CSS_LBL="Remove CSS:"
EO_REMOVE_CSS_URLS_LBL="Remove CSS URLs:"
EO_REMOVE_URLS_DESC="There may be cases where scripts or StyleSheets loaded on a website from other extensions may cause trouble so that a webmaster may not be able to find a way to disable/remove them without modifying core code. A temporary solution is to use these fields and add those URLs that need to be removed from the 'head' (one per line).<br><br><b>Note:</b> This is a highly discouraged method or way of keeping your website online. Use this as a temporary solution only. Request from your developers to give you options. If the Scripts or StyleSheets do not get removed, it means that they get loaded without using the Joomla framework functions. URLs outside the 'head' section of the page will not be detected. The fields are Case-Sensitive. You can add either full, or part of the URLs to be removed (full is recommended)."

EO_FIRST="First"
EO_LAST="Last"
EO_CSS_MEDIA_TYPE_LBL="CSS Media Type:"

In reality browsers seem to apply 'all' if the attribute is omitted."
EO_CUSTOM_CDN_LBL="Custom CDN:"
EO_CUSTOM_CDN_DESC="If you use a CDN (i.e., MaxCDN) and you want to use it as a source (prefix all your local URLs with your CDN URL), then enable this option. This will have the effect of changing all URLs to start with your CDN URL and deliver all local content from it. If you do not use a CDN or your CDN does not provide you a special URL but works as a proxy (i.e. CloudFlare) keep this disabled."
EO_CUSTOM_CDN_URL_LBL="Custom CDN URL:"

EO_LOCAL_URLS_LBL="Local URLs:"
EO_LOCAL_URLS_DESC="This setting controls the local URLs to all files (i.e., JS, CSS) generated and/or controlled by this plug-in when the Custom CDN is disabled.<br><br><b>Relative</b> URLs contain only the path, without the Scheme and Host/Domain (FQDN).<br>Example: /path/to/file.js<br><br><b>Scheme Relative</b> are Absolute URLs without the Scheme, so that they always follow the page's Scheme respectively and avoid various conflicts such as when an http url is requested from an https page.<br>Example: //www.example.com/path/to/file.js<br><br><b>Absolute</b> URLs contain the Scheme (http or https), the Host or Fully Qualified Domain Name (www.example.com) and the rest of the path if available (/path/to/file.js).<br>Example: http://www.example.com/path/to/file.js"

It specifies all domain levels, including the top-level domain and the root zone.<br><br><b>Examples:</b><br>example.com<br>www.example.com<br>blog.example.com<br>other.subdomain.example.com<br><br>When set to Auto, the current one will be used. This means that in the case you are able to access i.e., example.com from www.example.com (or any other subdomain), then the current Domain (FQDN) will be the one you access it from. For users that prefer Scheme Relative or Absolute Local URLs and need to force the plug-in to use a specific Domain (FQDN) that will not change, then the 'Custom' option should be used.<br><br>If you have set the $live_site variable in your configuration.php file, then you should not worry and choose Auto here, although on websites that use both http and https on different pages the $live_site causes trouble and is not recommended."
EO_FQDN_CUSTOM_LBL="Custom Domain (FQDN):"
EO_FQDN_CUSTOM_DESC="Accepted format should be without scheme (http or https), without :// and without the relative path.<br><br><b>Correct Entry Examples:</b><br>example.com<br>www.example.com<br>other.subdomain.example.com<br><br><b>Wrong Entry Examples:</b><br>http://example.com<br>http://www.example.com/joomla/<br>http://example.com/index.php<br>www.example.com/joomla"

EO_CUSTOM="Custom"
EO_AREA_LBL="Area:"
EO_AREA_DESC="Anything you load through this plugin depends on the jQuery Library (i.e., the jQuery UI, Twitter Bootstrap, Chosen, Easing or Custom Media), so when you choose to load any of them to an area, then the jQuery library must be loaded respectively to the same area. For example, if you set jQuery UI on Site And Administrator (All) then set the jQuery library on Site And Administrator (All) as well.<br><br><b>Note:</b> Joomla 3 loads the jQuery library in both Site and Administrator by default. Joomla 2.5 does not load any jQuery library.

Your website will first send a cURL request to check availability. If the CDN Source is not available or the requested library is not found on the CDN, then the local copy will be used.<br><br><b>Notes:</b> If you have enabled and use the Custom CDN from the Advanced tab then the fallback will be to that URL (your CDN). You need cURL enabled on your server for this feature to work. Also, if you have enabled the 'System - Cache' plug-in in Joomla, then this feature cannot work properly. This option may slow down the page load, depending on network or if enabled on many elements."

EO_CUSTOM_URLS_DESC="The URLs you can use can be either Local/Internal or External. You can use any number of URLs (one per line).<br><br><b>Local/Internal URLs:</b><br>If you use Local/Internal URLs, the best way to go is use relative paths in these fields so that you can control their Scheme from the Advanced tab of the plug-in. It is recommended to place your custom folder/directory inside the /media/ directory.<br>Example JS: media/my-custom-folder/script.js<br>Example CSS: media/my-custom-folder/styles.css<br><br><b>External URLs:</b><br>If you use external URLs from another domain, make sure they are either Scheme Relative, or they begin with http or https and that the source and scripts are trustworthy.
